# Pheonix + React JSON based basic auth

This repo is a super simple combo of basic auth for Pheonix and React. I generated the pheonix controller auth and then converted it to JSON, so I could use it with React.

If you are going to use this you will need to find and replace localhost:3000 and localhost:4567 for the React and Pheonix origins respectively.

Good luck ðŸ«¡
